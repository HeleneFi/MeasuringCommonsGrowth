MeasuringCommonsGrowth
======================

An inquiry into possibilities to measure the growth of the commons in their widest definitions.

In the context of looking at [sustainability from a commons perspective](http://commonsabundance.net/2013/07/13/rethinking-sustainable-development-in-terms-of-commons/), I have been wondering whether Value Network Analysis had been used to measure variation in externality flow and depletion / replenishment of commons.

What I have in mind is the following: 

I am taking a broad definition of the commons, considering them as the factors of enablement, the distributed factors of opportunity and thrivability, the 'field' to graze from that makes individual or community activity possible (in terms of what is available and accessible), and that needs to be perpetually renewed ans sustained. I would like to find ways to monitor the flows in form of 'externality' and identify where and how commons use value is created or depleted.

So if the commons (in their economic, social and natural form, for example in the form of knowledge, resources, health and diversity of possibilities etc...) provide an input as positive externality to an entity, I would like to be able to measure:
• How much/How/into what is this input transformed by human systems, organizations??
• What value (tangible or intangible) is added to (or substracted from) it through the activity?
• From the value added to it, how much is 'released' as a surplus as externality output (hopefully 'positive'), the contribution of the activity to the whole, to nourrish the field of emergence or factors of enablement (the commons) that will serve as input to other entities, in similar or other place and time?
• How much is 'retained' (enclosed or captured) by the activity for the sole benefit of its owners?
• How much toxic by-products (negative externality output) are rejected to deplete the field of emergence, conditions, factors of enablement (the commons) and at what cost to the whole, now and in the future? 

This would be a good way to measure sustainability and the variation in prosperity...

In terms of measurements themselves, we could use 'derivatives' to measure the variation of a commons, as an indicator of its replenishment or its depletion, and of the commons as the whole. Finding ways to measure it without going through an evaluation of the absolute value of the commons itself, using 'sensors' to assess in what direction the variation is operating, including human sensors through 'sentiment' reporting. This could be done by gathering local data and looking for patterns in the data. In this respect the research of UN [Global Pulse with their research on data patterns and work on hunches](http://www.unglobalpulse.org/technology/hunchworks) is quite advanced
